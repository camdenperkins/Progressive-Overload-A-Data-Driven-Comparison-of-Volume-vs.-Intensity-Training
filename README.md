# Volume-Vs-Intensity-Gym-Training
This independent project was completed using excel to track my workouts, listed by exercise name, weight, and repeitions.

# Background
I began weight training during the fall semester of my Junior year at Elon Univeristy, around late August in 2023. My workout plan was volume focused, using three sets on average for each exercise aiming for eight to ten repetitions. I saw continued growth for around a year but began to plateau rapidly around February 2025. As a result, I decided to focus on intensity training, with a focus of two sets per exercies aiming for four to six repetitions.

# Purpose
Will be comparing high volume to high intensity weight training. Both types of training were performed until failure. <br>
I utilized the "Push Pull Legs" training split, which means chest/triceps/front and side delts, followed by back/biceps/rear-delts, and then ending with legs. I then completed this routine again, thus exercising muscle groups twice per week. 

High volume: February 3-February 27
High intensity: April 11-May 6
