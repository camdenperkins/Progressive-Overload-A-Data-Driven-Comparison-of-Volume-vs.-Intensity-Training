# Volume-Vs-Intensity-Gym-Training
This independent project was done and tracked by me using excel to track my workouts, listed by exercise name, weight, and repeitions.

I began weight training during the fall semester of my Junior year at Elon Univeristy, around late August in 2023. My workout plan was volume focused, using three sets on average for each exercise. 

Will be comparing high volume (completing three sets per exercise) to high intensity (completing just two sets). Both types of training were performed until failure. 

High volume: February 3-February 27
High intensity: April 11-May 6
